# CRIM-Q
CRIM-Q is supposed to be an organization and reporting system for the Querétaro state police, so the can see any tipe of crimes that the society reports, also it helps to the transparency system because the people can see if they report is already being followed up, in addition to being able to see the other complaints and the date the police began following them up, in addition to improving the organization, this will allow citizens to contribute to public safety in the state of Querétaro and later an application can be developed for faster access.

The main class is User, which is abstract and has basic information like id, name, email, password, and methods like login and logout. Three classes inherit from User: Citizen, Police, and Administrator. Citizens can report crimes, check the status of their reports, and see public reports. Police have extra info like badge number and department, and they can assign reports, update follow-ups, and change the report status. Administrators can manage users, delete reports, and generate system statistics. A Citizen can create multiple CrimeReport objects. Each CrimeReport has details like type of crime, location, date, description, status, and whether it is public. It also belongs to one Citizen. Each report can have multiple FollowUp entries, which are updates made by Police officers. A FollowUp has a date, comment, progress, and links to the Police officer who made it. This way, the system shows how reports are tracked and updated by the police while allowing citizens to follow the process.
